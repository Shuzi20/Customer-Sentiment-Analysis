# Customer-Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from the e-commerce sector to classify sentiments as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Using VADER for initial sentiment classification and machine learning techniques for further refinement, we successfully identified sentiment trends and actionable insights. Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective model, achieving an impressive 96% accuracy. This analysis provides valuable insights to help businesses enhance customer satisfaction and tailor their strategies.
